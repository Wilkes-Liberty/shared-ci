"""Fail a pull request whose commits, identities, or prose carry AI-attribution credit.

Wilkes & Liberty work reads as authored by the human operator. This is not about
hiding that AI tooling is used -- naming a tool, or shipping a CLAUDE.md, is
fine. The rule is about authorship and contribution CREDIT.

Three surfaces are scanned, because credit lands on all three: commit MESSAGES,
the commit AUTHOR and COMMITTER identities, and the PR title and body. The
identity scan was added after a pull request merged with `copilot-swe-agent[bot]`
in its author field and passed this check cleanly -- the trailers had been
stripped, and nothing looked at who the commit said wrote it.

A local commit hook cannot cover this on its own. GitHub composes "Commit
suggestion", "Apply suggestion" and Copilot Autofix commits **server-side**, so
no local `git commit` runs and no local hook fires. Once such a commit is merged
and tagged the trailer cannot be removed, because a tag pins history
permanently. Before merge is the only cheap window, which is where this runs.

This script is a drop-in: copy it and `attribution.yml` into a repo's
`.github/`. It is deliberately standalone and stdlib-only, so it runs on any
runner with no install step and a repo that vendors it takes on no dependency.

Usage:
  check-attribution.py --base <sha> --head <sha> [--title-file F] [--body-file F]

Exits 0 when clean, 1 when an attribution is found, 2 on a usage error.

PATTERNS is kept identical to the local commit guard's list. Edit one, edit
both, or the two controls start disagreeing about what is forbidden.

Wilkes & Liberty work is never credited to AI -- not in commits, PR titles or
bodies, code, docs, changelogs or tickets. Work reads as authored by the human
operator.

This is NOT about hiding that AI tooling is used. Shipping a CLAUDE.md, or
naming a tool in prose, is fine. The rule is about authorship CREDIT.

To fix a COMMIT, before merging (it cannot be removed afterwards -- tags pin it):

    git rebase -i <base>          # squash or reword the offending commit(s)
    git push --force-with-lease

If the trailer came from GitHub's "Commit suggestion" or Copilot Autofix, do not
use that button. Read the suggestion, apply the edit yourself, and commit it
under your own name.

To fix an AI AUTHOR or COMMITTER IDENTITY, rewording is not enough -- the claim
is in the commit's identity fields, not its message. WHICH field is wrong
decides the fix, and the wrong one destroys credit that was correct:

  * AUTHOR is the AI (the usual case -- an agent wrote the commit):

        git rebase -i <base>          # mark the commit `edit`
        git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit
        git rebase --continue

  * COMMITTER only, author is a human who should keep the credit (a
    server-side "Commit suggestion" applied to someone else's work).
    Do NOT use --reset-author here; it would overwrite that human with you:

        git rebase -i <base>          # mark the commit `edit`
        git commit --amend --no-edit  # re-stamps committer, author untouched
        git rebase --continue

Then `git push --force-with-lease`. The commit's content is untouched either
way. `git log --format='%an <%ae> / %cn <%ce>'` shows which field is which.

The same button is usually the cause. An agent that opens or updates a pull
request commits under its own identity, so accepting its commits wholesale
credits it in `git log` -- which is more visible than a trailer, not less.
Take the change, not the commit.

To fix a PR TITLE or BODY, just edit it here -- no history rewrite needed.
